# Project: Data Lake


## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Objective

This project builds an ETL pipeline that extracts the data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads them back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow the analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Dataset

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is the song dataset, which consists of many song files. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. <br />
Below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```json
{
    "num_songs": 1, 
     "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
     "artist_latitude": null,
     "artist_longitude": null,
     "artist_location": "",
     "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
     "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
     "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
     "duration": 152.92036,
     "year": 0
}
```
### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format. The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. <br />
Below is an example of the data format in a log file.
```json
{
   "artist": "Barry Tuckwell/Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields/Sir Neville Marriner",
   "auth": "Logged In",
   "firstName": "Mohammad",
   "gender": "M",
   "itemInSession": 0,
   "lastName": "Rodriguez",
   "length": 277.15872,
   "level": "paid",
   "location": "Sacramento--Roseville--Arden-Arcade, CA",
   "method": "PUT",
   "page": "NextSong",
   "registration": 1.54051176E12,
   "sessionId": 961,
   "song": "Horn Concerto No. 4 in E flat K495: II. Romance (Andante cantabile)",
   "status": 200,
   "ts": 1543279932796,
   "userAgent": "\"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.143 Safari/537.36\"",

}
```

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
### Fact Table
1- songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables
1- users - users in the app<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level<br />
2- songs - songs in music database<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration<br />
3- artists - artists in music database<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude<br />
4- time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday<br />

## Project Files
1- etl.py reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3. <br />
2- dl.cfg contains the AWS credentials.<br />
3- README.md provides a discussion about the project.


## Running Script
1- Edit the ```dl.cfg``` file with the your AWS access keys<br />
2- Run ```etl.py```<br />
